NOTE: the default test cases are copied from the default-data directory into the
test_cases directory at the start of the program.

If you want to change the default test cases, change the files in the
default-data directory!

IMPORTANT: the file name for corresponding query and solution MUST be the same.

i.e. solution for src/default-data/test-cases/queries/query1.txt is src/default-data/test-cases/solutions/query1.txt
