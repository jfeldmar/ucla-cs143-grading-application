NOTES:
This README is for CS143 project 1A. It is a calculator written in PHP
to emulate the demo calculator as well as possible. The HTML portion
is basically a copy of the demo's HTML, so that it looks exactly like
the demo page. However, there are some cases where my calculator does
not return the same thing as the demo calculator.
These cases are exceptional cases where the demo calculator does not
behave as expected, such as "-1-+1".
