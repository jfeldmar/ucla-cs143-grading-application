Project 1A - Calculator:

      1. Algorithm
      upload each students *.php file to localhost
      for each student
	      restart server (use script to run ./shutdown and ./startup)
	      wait a few seconds
	      telnet or netcat(nc) to page (with and w/o input, get input from editable file)
	      parse output (i.e. get student's answer)
	      compare/record correctness
	      
	NOTE: calculator.php submission must have a tag with id='result' around
	calculation result and name=expr in the input tag where the math problem
	is to be inserted

Project 1B:
      run sql queries to make sure database generation done correctly
      check size and schema of tables
      ensure required integrity constraints implemented
      
Project 1C:
      Same process as 1A
      need to figure out a good way to extract output from HTML page
      run a solution script first to get comparison for grading

Project 2:
      requires different approach
