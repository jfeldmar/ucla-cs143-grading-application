Project 1A - Calculator:

      1. Algorithm
      upload each students *.php file to localhost
      for each student
	      restart server (use script to run ./shutdown and ./startup)
	      wait a few seconds
	      telnet or netcat(nc) to page (with and w/o input, get input from editable file)
	      parse output (i.e. get student's answer)
	      compare/record correctness

      2. Telnet vs. Netcat
      - netcat has easier redirection of output (can use -t option)
      - telnet solution: use 'script' command: run 'script </path/to/file>' before
      running telnet. All the text gets written to the terminal and also to
      /path/to/file. You have to do 'exit' or Ctrl-D to actually write to the file
      (man script)

      3. Example command (telnet):
      telnet localhost 8080
      GET /comprehensive/ HTTP/1.1
      OR GET /comprehensive/?expr=3+8 HTTP/1.1

      => returns the html page (store in temp folder)
      => get result by id (getElementById)
      => http/1.1 - persistent connection by default

      4. Scripting options
      - perl (has html TagParser)
      - python

Project 1B:
      run sql queries to make sure database generation done correctly
      check size and schema of tables
      ensure required integrity constraints implemented
      
Project 1C:
      Same process as 1A
      need to figure out a good way to extract output from HTML page
      run a solution script first to get comparison for grading

Project 2:
      requires different approach
