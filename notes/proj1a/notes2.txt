localhost at /var/www
start page: start.html
should redirect to initialize.cgi which generates initialize.html

NOTE: for CGI to work:
	- open file: /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
	- make sure ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ points to correct directory
		- in our case: /var/www/
		- this will allow cgi script in all subdirectories
		
NOTE: For file upload to work:
- make sure directory of where file is uploaded and cgi-bin directory have
permissions set to 777
- if n1-... script fails on deleting/creating directories (permission denied), change (chmod) mode
of src (top level directory) to 777

NOTE: Text::CSV Module must be installed for parsing of student data
	- add check at beginning of program to detect presence or required modules

TO-DO:
- add class="code" definition to CSS
- in n3, create option to display only the latest submitted files (by default),
if display all, show a "date/time submitted" column
	(how? read all SIDs in csv into array, take out duplicate from array)
