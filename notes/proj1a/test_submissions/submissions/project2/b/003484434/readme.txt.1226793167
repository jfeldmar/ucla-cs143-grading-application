--------

this was a really time-consuming project. wow. for this project, i largely worked 
with tarun solanki and sendie hudaya.

the only thing worth mentioning is the structures of the non/leafnodes:

	leaf node:
		metadata(16) | recordid(8) | key(4) | recordid(8) | key(4) | ... |

	non-leaf node:
		metadata(16) | pageid(4) | key(4) | pageid(4) | key(4) | ... |

i added one function for debugging: get_buffer that returns a pointer to an internal 
array of characters.

finally, there are nodetypes saved at *(buffer+0). non-leaf = 0 while leaf = 1.
