Part 2A was straightforward after you understand the Bruinbase architecture.  I wrote some pseudo-code to load,
read, and close files then implemented the code.  

Part 2B was pretty hard mainly because we weren't sure how to test the functionality of our BTreeNode classes. 
Also, it was hard to differentiate between what a BTLeafNode took care of and a BTNonLeafNode did.  
We implemented our BTreeNodes thinking about BTreeIndex and how that will use the nodes to create the index.
