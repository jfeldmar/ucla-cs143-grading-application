Modified sqlengine to use the indexing feature (via BTreeIndex) in loading and selecting tuples. Works on all test cases, significantly reducing the number of page reads on queries involving key ranges or key equalities.
Works correctly on all of the example test cases, and everything else I threw at it.
Fixed a few bugs in the BTreeNode and BTreeIndex classes as well.
