--------

for project 2c, i worked once again on the project with sendie hudaya and 
tarun solanki. for the most part, collaboration was performed within the 
scope of testing the index. 

the index takes care of all test cases provided in test.sh and also utilizes 
the index for <> cases when conditions on keys allow for efficient look-up in 
the index.

one caveat for this is the fact that the program is limited in working with 
multiple <> cases. the array of the size is limited to 10 conditions which is 
a reasonable limitation. the odds that a query has 10 <> conditions on either 
key or value is small enough to not worry about it. the fact that a query 
with <> conditions along with other conditions on key has to search through 
this array decreases efficiency by a small amount.
