Using the index for large range queries was disappointingly slow. We could have optimised queries like that by not using the index, but we aren't allowed to.

Our tree should handle queries using keys that are very large or very small (type int). But we kept the professor's code when not using the tree, and that part does not handle very large/small keys.

We hope you throw everything you have at our tree implementation. We've spent too much time on it, it's only a nice thing to do.

Thank you.
