This project proved to be very difficult for me.
I had a hard time initially grasping the general API and structure (specifically the use of buffers and files).
Not helping the situation ive spent the last 2 weeks in bed with strep throat (including on my 21st birthday). And only recently Sunday did I finally feel well enough to see a tutor, which finally got me accustomed to the project and got me to understand what I was doing,
however it was just not enough time to be able to finish it.  Most areas are started and you can see where I was going, but it is not completed to the point i wanted it to be.

Thanks,
Matt
