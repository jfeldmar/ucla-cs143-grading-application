With the submission of these last files, project 2 comes to an end. it was a very interesting project, and the
knowledge gaiend by implementing the B+ tree is sure to be useful. however, there was a very interesting
observation when some queries were run. Instead of running faster than regular implementation, the B+ tree
actually ran slower. This happened a lot when practically the whole table needed to be read, or when preprocessing
for values and bonds were done in my code. i don't understand why the second case caused this, but i did not have time
to investigate it too much. one important thing that i did notice was the fact that the pages read were as much as 4 times!
i have no idea why this happened.
