I was not able to get multiple key conditions working, but I do have one key
condition working perfectly. I was able to get everything up to the large data
set working, but I have not tested the x-large data set.

I spent a lot of time on this project. I would estimate about 50-60 hours. If
my program fails a lot of the test cases, please take a look at my code and read
the comments and try to understand the amount of work I put into this project.
This was my most challenging class this year, but I think it was also the most
worthwhile and productive class as well.
