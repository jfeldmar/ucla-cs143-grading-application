The biggest challenge so far was to understand how the BruinBase API works.
First I read and understood how RecordFile works and figured out how to read 
each line from the input file, parsed it and then load it into the RecordFile created.
I tested the newly created table (test.tbl) by running queries against it and
it performed in a similar way to the movie.tbl table. Furthermore, appending
to an existing table also worked just fine. Moving on to 2B.
