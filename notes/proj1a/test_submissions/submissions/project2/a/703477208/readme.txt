For the project 2 a, there was nothing substantial to be done. All we had to do was open a connection to 
the file to be read using fstream open(), get a line using getline(), give it to parseLoadLine() to parse 
the line into key, value pair, and then append to the table using append(). points to note: open needs a character
pointer, and fails to work if string is given!
