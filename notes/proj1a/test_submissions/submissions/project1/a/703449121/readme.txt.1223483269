This program catches divide by 0 and returns Undefined if the expression contains divide by 0.
Otherwise, it returns the result returned by eval and attempts to follow the demonstration program as closely as possible.
Octal numbers do not receive any special handling.  They go straight to eval.

My definition of a valid expression is as follows:
It must begin with a number.
	Numbers may contain digits from 0-9 and up to one period.
It may also include an operator and an operand.
	The operator may be +, -, *, or /.
	The operand must be a number.
Any number of operator/operand pairs may follow.
In addition...
	No spaces are allowed.
	No parenthesis are allowed.

Some notable test cases
No expression = blank output.
0/0 = Undefined
1+3/0 = Undefined
-1 = Invalid input expression
.1 = Invalid input expression
Octal numbers return unusual results.
Hex numbers = Invalid input expression.
1,234 = Invalid input expression.
1E10 = Invalid input expression.
pi = Invalid input expresson.
1+-1 = Invalid input expression.
