----------

the only assumption made would be that the file remain named as "calculator.php" 
because when referencing an action for the <form> tag, calculator.php is used. 

from what was tested, all functions of my calculator.php and the demo calculator 
are the same, down to the error messages and formatting of results.

in line with the demo calculator, expressions that consist only of a number 
beginning with 0 will be interpreted as an octal. any other strange behavior as 
a result of using eval() will also be reflected. 

virtually all decimals are supported in my version of calculator.php. example:

	89067/8+0.9+.8+9. 

will properly validate under calculator.php while the online calc will be unable 
to parse this correctly. calculator.php will consider any numbers of the form

	abcd.
	.abcd
	ab.cd

to be valid. as a result, calculator.php covers a wider range of possible valid 
numerical values. possible exceptions include expressions such as

	.999/.999

which fails to validate under both the provided calc and calculator.php.
