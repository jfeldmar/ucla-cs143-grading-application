It was a little confusing that the data given to us had minor difference from the data on the demo site because it misled me to think that my queries weren't working correctly or that I had loaded the tables incorrectly. However, once I realized that the demo was merely an example and not something to base my project off of, everything else seemed to go fine. The most difficult part was figuring out how to display the results in an html table.
