The SQL query interface automatically filters out queries that do not start with SELECT or SHOW statements.
For violate.sql, the comments preceding each query describe how constraints are violated. The MySQL error messages follow, then the query itself.
For create.sql, the comments preceding each query describe the constraints applied to each table.
