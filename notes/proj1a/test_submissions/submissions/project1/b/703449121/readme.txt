The work was divided as follows:
create.sql and load.sql were implemented by Raymond Moy.
queries.sql and query.php were implented by Jeffrey Su.
Constraints were done jointly.
violate.sql was primarily implemented by Raymond Moy.

Each section was discussed jointly before or after impementation.
Implementation was done individually.

Additional notes:
Null values display as an empty cell.
The user does not need to enter the database name.
SHOW TABLES is not implemented, because it is not a valid SELECT command.
MySQL error messages are gracefully displayed to the user.
The data in our version is different than the project demo.
