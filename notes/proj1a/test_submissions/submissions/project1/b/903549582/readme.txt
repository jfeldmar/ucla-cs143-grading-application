As a team, we did pair programming and tested/verified the logics together.

Functionalities
1) A php page(query.php) links to our database so that users can input SQL queries.
2) Movie related SQL databases are created and given data is loaded from files provided.
3) Based on the description, we created database schema such as primary key, foreign key and data integrity constraints.
4) We verified our schema with SQL queries which violate the constraints.
(violate.sql file: Because each SQL query returns an error message and
 won't go on to any of the other queries, we commented the queries violating database schema)
5) We tested operations of our schema with SQL queries and those queries return correct answers.
6) In load.sql file, we insert MAX ID values into MaxPersonID and MaxMovieID tables.
