Project 1B


This is the first project setting up and loading a database. In this case we used two: TEST and CS143.
For development of the project, I used the following websites:

http://oak.cs.ucla.edu/cs143/project/mysql/intro.html
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql.html

The project is a combination of html and php languages.
To use the SQL Query of the databases, open a browser and supply URL:
http://192.168.162.128/~cs143/query.php

I completed the project without a partner. I used the websites
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-php-regex1/index.html
http://us.php.net/manual/en/
and my CS35L class notes to complete the assignment.
Also the discussion was equally helpful.
