I didn't know where to put the answer to "
Write down in English a list of constraints that you can think of that your database should satisfy. Consider only constraints that go beyond what is already enforced in the schema (e.g., you do not need to specify that ratings are integers)."
therefore, I am putting the asnwer here:
MovieDatabase system
	each Movie id should be unique
	each Actor id should be unique
	each Director id should be unique
	each date of birth cannot be null
	title cannot be null
	year cannot be null or zero or more than present year
	sex of the actor cannot be other than 'male' or 'female'

*the SQL coding are added to the create.sql with comments.

I had hard time with .php part because I am not familiar with php and html that I didn't know how to create a nice table and I didn't have time to make a nice table.
The mysql part is not that hard and rather fun.
