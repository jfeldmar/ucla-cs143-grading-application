Notes: 

1. Did not reinforce the integrity check that an Actor and a Director can
share the same id (i.e. There is an Actor with same id as a Director, but they
are diferent people.  I think a table named Person should exist in order to ha-
ve this integrity check in mySQL, since Check's are not supported).

2. MaxPersonID and MaxMovieID tables do not get any data into them.  In the 
project description it said that the implementation was going to be done in 
Project 1C, but the submit portion of project 1b said to make sure that 
load.sql inserts the appropriate tuples in these tables, so I didn't know if 
I had to do it or not, the project specificiation was not clear.

3. Did not "cut-and-paste" the output I got from the constraints because I 
couldn't figure out how to do it from the Virtual Machine to a file. So I just
typed it in myself, at least the beginning of the error message.
