----------

during the course of working on this project, there was collaboration 
between i and two classmates: sendie hudaya and tarun solanki. largely, 
we worked on establishing the constraints for the database.

the query.php file is pretty much a carbon-copy of the demo one offered 
on the specs page, such as formatting of the page and also the formatting 
of the output as a table. again, i'm assuming that all input is valid.

most of the project was spent logged in as root using the database test2 
and after everything worked for sure, the .sql scripts were run on the 
CS143 database and everything worked smoothly.

the hardest part of the project was trying to come up with the second 
required query to write (number of actors in multiple movies). 
everything else was largely rather easy. i'm looking forward to the next 
part of the project.
