I got everything to work, but the output of the query on query.php isn't
as polished as I'd like it to be. I do believe that it meets all the
requirements of the specification though.
Here is what it says for query.php:

"Create a php page that allows users to type in a SQL SELECT statement in a
text input box and submit the query through a Web browser. Given a user query,
your php code needs to execute the query on MySQL, return the results as the
results page in an HTML table. The query result should be presented in a
legible form. The input box and the submit button should be preserved in
the result page to allow for additional querying."

My query.php does all that, but doesn't label the columns of the query result,
and I also couldn't figure out how to print only the required number of columns.
