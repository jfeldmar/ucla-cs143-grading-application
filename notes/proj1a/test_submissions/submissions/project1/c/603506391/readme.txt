\f0\fs24 \cf0 The project required us to have one search page , two insert pages, and three browsing pages. Our implementation for this project is that we have a header page where you can change your operation whenever the user want. We then implemented a search page for searching actor or movie names. We also got a insert movie page where the user can provide information about a new movie. Besides, we have another page for user to insert new director or actor. Finally, we have a page for the user to insert comments about a particular movie.\

We split the work of this project evenly. I think our cooperation is very efficient and we enjoyed this project very much}
