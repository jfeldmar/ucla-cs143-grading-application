Basically, i implemented all the features required for the project.
This included adding all enteries to movie, Actor, director and comments.
I also managed to get the date on date of birth working, which a lot of the people could not.
As an additional feature, all my sites have refrential links, making hit the back button
a thig of the past!
Since i did not have too much time, i could not make the site aesthitically pleasing.
I believe that this could be fixed by working in a group.
My emphasis was mostly on coding, and i tried to make sure that every error condition and
unknown coditions are handled gracefully.
Any deficiencies with the underlying database system were also cloak using check condition
while coding in php.
One really interesting piece of advice i got was from my friend Sendie who gave me very
important pointers on hot to handle multiple checkbox input using arrays!
