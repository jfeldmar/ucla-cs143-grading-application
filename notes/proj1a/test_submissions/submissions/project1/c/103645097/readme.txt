I have implemented all of the required features, as described below:

Page I1(input actor/director information): Can be accessed through links in the browsing pages, or from the search pages.
Page I2(input comments): In the movie information page a form is displayed allowing the user to add comments.
Page I3(input movie information): Can be accessed through links in the browsing pages or from the search pages.

Page B1(actor information): Accessed from the search page, or from a movie page. Shows links to the movies the actor was in, actor information, and links to update the actor's information/movie credits.
Page B2(movie information): Accessed from the search page, or from an actor or director page. Shows information about the movie (genres, MPAA rating etc), who the directors are, and a list of the actors in the movie. Also it lists all the comments by users as well as the average rating, and allows users to enter new comments.

Page S1(search page): Allows searching for movies, actors, and directors.

I have also implemented the following additional features:
The ability to browse through a list of all movies/actors/directors, alphabetically.
Advanced searching option- exclude movies of certain genres.
Context-sensitive links, for example add an actor to a movie from the movie's info page.
The ability to create new directors, actors, or movies from scratch.
The ability to browse other movies produced by the same production company.
A pretty nice looking browsing interface.
