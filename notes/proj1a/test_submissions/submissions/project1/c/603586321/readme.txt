	I will be using 2 late days for this project.
	I met all the project criteria. I divide this project into three groups of pages. Those dealing with movies, with directors, and with actors. Each group had its own search interface (I split Page S1 into several pages) along with a page that displayed all the data for that group (showing 20 enteries per page). Each group also had an interface to add a new entry to its table (I2, I3) as well as an interface for displaying the data available for each entry (B1, B2). The movie add page allowed a user to add the directors, genres, and actors associated with that movie and the movie display page has an interface to add reviews and read other peoples reviews (I combined paged B2, I2 and I3).
