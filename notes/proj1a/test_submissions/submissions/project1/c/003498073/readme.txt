Note that my submission is using three grace periods out of the four remaining that I have.

My implementation of project 1C statisfies all the criteria of the specifications.  One noticable difference is
that I made three search pages, one for each different kind of search because each one was based on different
attributes and thus required different information.  My implementation of Add Actor, Add Director, Add Review are
straightforward.  I put in some constraints (using PHP) that certain pieces of information must be entered 
otherwise you would be taken to an error page.  The movie page in particular was a little complicated because
I based my implementation on the fact that all movies must have at least one director and actor/actress. 
This constaint was satisfied with multiple pages.  I have made numerous PHP file because it helped me organize
my thinking and implementations.  

The functionality is all satisfied, however I didn't put on constraints on "bad user input" such as letters for
a value that should be a number, non alphanumeric characters in the title of a movie, etc.
