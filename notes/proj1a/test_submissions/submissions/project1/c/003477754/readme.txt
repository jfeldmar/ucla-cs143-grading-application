For the most part, I was able to implement all the basic requirements as specified in the project
documentation and the project demo provided by the TA.  

For better user experience, I implemented a table to arrange the different input fields.  
Also for checkboxes in genre, I used an array to capture the checkboxes selected for ease of multiple genre insertions.  
There was also another feature that was found on the internet that helped me tremendously with checking if a date is correctly typed or not, a function called checkdate.

If there were more time, I would want to implement a better error messaging system.  Currently my error
messaging system warns user about empty or invalid inputs.  Unfortunately, when the user enters that
page for the first time, the error message will be displayed because the input fields are set to be empty at first.
