I think I met all the project criteria, meaning that there is a link to jump from search to Actor/Movie Information, link from Actor information to Movie information, link from Movie Information to Actor Information.
Add Actor/Director, Add Comments, Add Movie and Add Movie/Actor relation. 
When I started to add more to the site, certain pages becomes very heavy that it ran out of memory constantly (in the both Movie/Actor Information site).  Therefore, I am worried and wondering if I did something wrong to it.
There is also a link to Add Review from Actor Information
.
The website is very similar to the Demo site.

The major problem I had with this project is that the php "insert" duplicate data due to the auto increment.
I tried to figure out how to fix the problem and it took me 2 whole days to fix it.  That is why I had to use one
grace period.
I am kind of worry about the URL part, because I never tried with other computer, so I don't know if I have done it correctly.

Over all, this is by far the most fun project out of project 1.  I enjoyed it very much! and ofcourse I learned a lot from buiding it.
