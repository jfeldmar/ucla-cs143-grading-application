For this project, I implemented 4 input pages.
1. A page to let users add actor or director information
2. A page to let users add comments to movies
3. A page to let users add movie information
4. A page to let users add a movie/actor relation

I also implemented two browsing pages
1. A page that shows actor information
	It has links to the movies that the actor was in
2. A page that shows movie information
	It has links to the actors in the movie
	It shows the average rating of the movie
	It shows all user comments
	It has a link for users to add new comments

I also have one search page that allows users to search keywords in movie titles or actor names.

I did not implement any significant additional features because of the time constraint with other classes and whatnot. 

This assignment was pretty fun to work on and play around with. Once you get the hang if making the first few pages, it is simple to set up the rest of the website. This is a good way to get students interested in databases!
