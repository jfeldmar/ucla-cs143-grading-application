Please note that when I wrote my "load.sql" file, the file path "./data/FILENAME.del" didn't work when I tried it.
Instead I used "~/data/FILENAME.del" when I was testing (which worked) and then changed it back to what the project spec
specified in order to recieve full credit.

My site implented all the criteria that the spec required.  It has clickable links to all actors from movie info pages
and displays the results orderly and neatly.  In a team setting, the search results could have been improved and narrowed.
In addition to that the presentation could have been better.
