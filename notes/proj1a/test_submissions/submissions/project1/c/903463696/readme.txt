I designed a website that features all of the required pages and runs in the same manner as the demo website.
It has four input pages, one for adding a person: either an actor or director, and their information, one for
adding a movie, one for a detailed review on that movie timestamped, and one to add a relation between an actor
and the movie they were in, stating their role. There are two browsing pages where can access all of the given
information about each actor or movie and a nice error message if there are none, along with links to the rest of
the information. The home page and also the search page is able to search any actor or movie information.

I did not add any extra features, but tried to format the page somewhat like IMDB.com in that it has gray sidebars 
and the same color and font scheme. I also altered the icon on the top to say CMDB: The CS 143 Movie DataBase to
be unique to our class and add some style to the page.

I worked alone without any partners.
