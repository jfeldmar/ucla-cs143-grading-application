I implemented three input pages: a page that lets users add actor and director information, a page that lets users add comments to movies, and a page that lets users add movie information. I also implemented four browsing pages: a page that shows actor information, a page that shows director information, a page that shows company information, and a page that shows movie information. Furthermore, I implemented a search page and a browsing page.
