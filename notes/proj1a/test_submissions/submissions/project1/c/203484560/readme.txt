We met all of the project criteria. The biggest changes that we made were to the organization of the pages. For the 
input2 page, we implemented that under the "browsing2" page. The input3 page was then renamed "input2." The search 
page was implemented on its own, but you can also conduct a search from any of the Web pages via a search bar in the
navigation sidebar. The ability to review a movie is at the bottom of every movie information page instead of being
on a separate page where the user has to choose the movie he or she is reviewing. For each actor's page in the "Look
for Actor Information" set, there is functionality that enables the user to add movie role information about that
specific actor.

Some of the extra features we implemented are as follows:
There is a search bar in the navigation sidebar.
When browsing actors, the drop down list of actors can be sorted by last name, first name, date of birth, date of 
death and person ID.
When browsing directors, the drop down list of directors can be sorted by last name, first name, date of birth, date of 
death and person ID.
We have a page where a user can browse director info. On this page a user can also add a director to a film.
We check input for special characters &, ", ', < and > using the function htmlspecialchars().
When adding a new movie, a user can attach a director to that movie.

Work distribution:
Raymond implemented the "Add New Movie" and "Look for Movie Information" pages. He also implemented the movie review
functionality, which was then tied into the "Look for Movie Information" page.
Jeffrey implemented the "Add New Actor/Director," "Look for Actor Information," and "Look for Director Information" 
pages. He also implemented the "Search for an Actor or Movie" page and was the main designer of the look of the pages.

We created the Web pages separately, and when one of us would finish with a page, we sent it to the other person so 
that he could test out the interfaces between his pages and the newly created page.

I think one of the things we could have done to improve our work in a team setting is to have gone over the architecture 
of the project and discussed in more detail than we did what the functionality of each page would be. Since this project
was not too complicated, however, it wasn't difficult to change the functionality of our pages as we created them.
